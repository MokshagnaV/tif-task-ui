### The Internet Folks (TIF) Task 1: Build UI

This repository contains a static page. I have developed it using the figma design provided by TIF.

The tech stack used:
- React using CRA
- Tailwindcss

As stated in the task, CSS-in-JS (chakra-UI) can be used. I also have knowledge of ChakraUI but I have not used it here, because the design contains simple components, for which the ChakraUI library is not required. Those components can be easily designed using CSS.
